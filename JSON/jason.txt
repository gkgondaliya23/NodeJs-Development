JSON:-

    json stands for JavaScript Object Notation

    The JSON object contains methods for parsing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and converting values to JSON.
    It can't be called or constructed, and aside from its two method properties, it has no interesting functionality of its own.

    JavaScript and JSON differences:-

    JSON is a syntax for serializing objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null. It is based upon JavaScript syntax but is distinct from it: some JavaScript is not JSON.

        JSON is recognized natively by JavaScript
        It allows you to transmit and serialize structured data using a network connection.
        You can use it with modern programming languages.
        JSON is text which can be converted to any object of JavaScript into JSON and send this JSON to the server.
